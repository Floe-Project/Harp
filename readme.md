# Free Multisampled Harp

This is a Floe-compatible version of Versilian Studios Etherealwinds Harp 2: Community Edition.

It's a high quality multisampled 'sustained' plucked harp sample library. It's free to download and use. However, you must attribute the original authors of the samples if you share your music. Floe helps with this: https://floe.audio/about/attribution.html

A Floe Lua file as been added, but otherwise the library is unchanged.
