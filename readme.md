# Free Multisampled Celtic Harp

Floe-compatible version of Versilian Studios Etherealwinds Harp 2: Community Edition whilst still working with SFZ players.

It's a high quality multisampled 'sustained' Celtic harp sample library. It's free to download and use. However, you must attribute the original authors of the samples if you share your music. Floe helps with this: https://floe.audio/about/attribution.html

Modifications made:
- Added Floe Lua file
- Converted all files to FLAC
- Added an image for use as the background in Floe (note this is not an image of the recorded harp)
- Subtly retuned the samples using [Signet](https://github.com/SamWindell/Signet)
